# KNN Based Classification on a Small Subset of CIFAR-10 Dataset
## Introduction
Humans poses a great capability in visual recognition tasks even though they may vary in size, pose, scale, and illumination. In the past many studies have been published to add human intelligence in computers. Recently, deep neural networks have shown great performance in visual perception tasks and have reported to surpass humans. Yet there is lack of thorough and fair comparison between human and artificial recognition systems.  CIFAR-10 dataset, a well know dataset of natural images. This dataset allows fair comparison with state-of-the-art deep neural networks. Convolutional neural networks show great performance on the benchmark dataset; however, they are still far from human recognition capabilities. Moreover, a detailed investigation using multiple levels of difficulty reveals that easy images for humans may not be easy for deep neural networks. [1]

The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, 10 classes) is a subset of the Tiny Images dataset and consists of 60000 32x32 color images. The images are labelled with one of 10 mutually exclusive classes: airplane, automobile (but not truck or pickup truck), bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck (but not pickup truck). There are 6000 images per class with 5000 training and 1000 testing images per class. [2]
